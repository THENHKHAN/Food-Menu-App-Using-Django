Retrieving objects¶
To retrieve objects from your database, construct a QuerySet via a Manager on your model class.

A QuerySet represents a collection of objects from your database. It can have zero, one or many filters. Filters narrow down the query results based on the given parameters. In SQL terms, a QuerySet equates to a SELECT statement, and a filter is a limiting clause such as WHERE or LIMIT.

You get a QuerySet by using your model’s Manager. Each model has at least one Manager, and it’s called objects by default. Access it directly via the model class.
The Manager is the main source of QuerySets for a model. For example, Blog.objects.all() returns a QuerySet that contains all Blog objects in the database.

**---> Retrieving a single object with get()¶
filter() will always give you a QuerySet, even if only a single object matches the query - in this case, it will be a QuerySet containing a single element.

If you know there is only one object that matches your query, you can use the 
get() method on a Manager which returns the object directly:

>>> one_entry = Entry.objects.get(pk=1)
You can use any query expression with get(), just like with filter() .
